updated all NewsGUI files with Navigation links
make pages "undecorated" i.e. removes X, minimise and maximise top border
it does mean that the application cannot be dragged around the screen
Set fonts to calibri 13 bold
Set icon buttons to agreed size
fixed page sizes all to 1024 x 768 (minor differences fixed)
rearranged other items on forms to line up with navigation buttons
